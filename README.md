# <HORISEON CODE - REFACTOR>

## Description

The purpose of the challenge was to improve the starter code given in order for there to be semantic HTML elements as well as cleaner CSS styling with appropriate comments. In addition, any missing links were added and tested to be working while alt text was given to images in order for the website to be more accessible.
